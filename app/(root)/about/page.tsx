                I didn't start coding because I had some big vision. I started because I felt guilty. I had spent my parents' money on JEE coaching and it didn't work out. So before college even started, I made one decision: I'm going to pay my own fees.
              </p>
              <p>
                No passion story. Just guilt and a decision. That turned into teaching myself to code, getting into open source, landing freelance clients, and eventually shipping 50+ products for clients across the world.

              Why I moved to product

            <p>
              At my freelancing peak I was making 2 lakh/month and closing 5 to 6 lakh projects. But I only ever saw version one. I never saw what happened after the MVP launched. Never saw scale. Never saw retention. I knew how to build. I didn't know how to think long term.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Helium, that changed. I built recommendation engines that delivered 20 to 30% merchant sales uplift. I reduced latency by 60%. I led a product initiative around conversational commerce. For the first time, my work was directly affecting real business outcomes. And whenever my suggestions got rejected, I felt it personally. That's when I understood I wasn't just an engineer anymore. I cared about product direction.
            </p>
            <p>
              I co-founded Zashit next. AI credit card reward optimizer. 50+ waitlist signups. YC application. Then it fell apart over cofounder misalignment. That failure taught me more about structured decision-making than any success.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every time I felt stuck, it wasn't because I couldn't build. It was because I wasn't strong at selecting the right problems, prioritizing effectively, or thinking in structured business terms. Product thinking directly attacks that weakness. That's why I moved to product. Not because it's trendy. Because it fills the exact gap in how I operate.
