  problem:
    "91% of people abandon their annual goals by February — not because they stop caring, but because the year goes abstract. The days slip by invisibly. People only feel the urgency when it's already December. The demand signal is enormous: a single @year_progress tweet saying '2024 is 50% complete' got 2.5M views and 26K likes. @progressbar_ built 880,000 Instagram followers posting nothing but year-progress content — with no product attached. Progress Bar OSX hit #1 on Product Hunt in 2018 with 617 upvotes and was never meaningfully updated. The highest-rated year-progress app on the Mac App Store today has 5 reviews. The Mac slot for this is open.",
  whatIBuilt:
    "A macOS menu bar app that shows one number — days remaining in the year — always visible, never intrusive. Backed by research: the 'days remaining' framing activates loss aversion 2x harder than elapsed percentages. The dropdown stacks year, month, and week urgency — each time scale serves a different decision. Designed to be calm: no color escalation, no alerts, no friction. The target user already pays for quality Mac tools (Things 3, Raycast, CleanShot) and doesn't need another system — they need a sharper ambient signal. The Sindre Sorhus slot for year progress, unoccupied since 2018.",
