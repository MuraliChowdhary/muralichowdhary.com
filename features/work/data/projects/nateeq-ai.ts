  problem:
    "ElevenLabs sells a powerful voice AI API. But APIs don't sell to business buyers. A Saudi IT company needed to resell AI voice assistants to GCC enterprises. ElevenLabs gives you agent creation and conversation endpoints. It does not give you multi-tenant isolation, embed code generation, lead extraction, billing, branding, or Arabic support.",
  whatIBuilt:
    "Took the platform from infrastructure to a shippable product in 6 weeks. Tenants create agents, test with live voice, generate a one-line embed code, deploy on any website, and see extracted leads in a dashboard. Built the ElevenLabs integration layer, widget embedding with cross-domain CORS, AI-powered lead extraction that turns voice conversations into a lead gen tool, and the admin console with RTL.
